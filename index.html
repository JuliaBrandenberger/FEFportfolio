                    <p>I'm a <a href="https://www.roguetheology.com">dance and theater artist</a> who decided to start learning web development. I've discovered that I enjoy the mental challenge and feeling of accomplishment that comes from solving problems through code.
                    </p>
                    <p>I've studied "How to Code Simple Data" and "How to Code Complex Data" through <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data">EdX with the University of British Columbia</a>.</p>
                    <p>I was part of the Fall 2021 cohort of <a href="https://www.vuevixens.org/">Front End Foxes</a>.</p>
                    <p>I've completed the Foundations Track of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>, where I firmed up my understanding of Javascript fundamentals and made some of the projects listed below.</p>
